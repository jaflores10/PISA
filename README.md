Factors Influencing Cross-country Differences in PISA Scores

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to evaluate secondary educational systems. This analysis will attempt to determine the following: 
- What explains cross-country differences in the performance of the PISA among countries?
- Why does the US rank consistently lower than other major economies despite greater wealth?
- Are there gender differences in PISA performance across countries?
- Does parents' socioeconomic status influence student performance?

## Methodology
- Visualizations - bubble plots, correlation matrices, and heat maps to identify trends
- Pooled Linear Regression Analysis - Statistical analysis for resting relationships between target variables and predictors across countries over time
